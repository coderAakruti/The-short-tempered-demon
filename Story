Once a upon a time, there was a very short-tempered demon.He would get angry 
at the smallest things.When angry , he had no control over his actions

One day , the demon decided to make a beautiful tree house for himself.
He worked hard for a week . After some days , a beautiful tree house was ready.
Just when it was ready a pegion flying above dropped a worm on his sholder.
